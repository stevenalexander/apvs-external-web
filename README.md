Beta implementation of the Assisted Prison Visits Scheme external web application.

## Requirements

* Docker (Including Docker Compose)
* Node 6 (Including NPM) - If running locally

## Run

### Locally
Install dependencies and run on port 3000.

```
npm install
npm start
```

### With Docker Compose
This will run the External Web application in development mode.

```
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

### Heroku

The application can be deployed to [heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) for quick preview.

```
heroku login
heroku create
heroku buildpacks:set heroku/nodejs

# Set config vars for application
# heroku config:set DB_USERNAME=mydbuser

git push heroku master
```

## Test

```
npm test                        # checks code against standard JS and runs mocha unit tests.
npm run-script test-coverage    # unit tests and generates code coverage using Istanbul
npm run-script test-unit        # unit tests
npm run-script test-integration # integration tests
npm run-script test-e2e         # e2e tests using selenium standalone against local application (must already be running)
npm run-script test-load        # Runs e2e load test script using [Artillery](https://artillery.io/)
```

Run e2e tests with [saucelabs](https://saucelabs.com)
```
# set environmental variables for saucelabs
export SAUCE_USERNAME='MY_USERNAME'
export SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY='MY_KEY'
export SAUCE_BASEURL='http://localhost:3000' # proxy url for sauce connect

npm run-script test-e2e-ie8
npm run-script test-e2e-firefox
npm run-script test-e2e-ios
npm run-script test-e2e-android

```

## Database

The application requires a MS SQL database instance, configured with an external web user and a migration user. See [here](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/apvs/tree/develop/database) for details.

The Internal Web has a series of knex seed files that define table functions that can be called from the External Web to retrieve previously submitted claims.

To run the [knex](http://knexjs.org/) database migrations and seeds:

```
npm run-script migrations
```

To rollback the last batch of changes:
```
npm run-script rollback
```

##Â Security

### CSRF
We are using [csurf](https://github.com/expressjs/csurf) for CSRF protection. All `POST` requests must have a valid CSRF token, which is added as a hidden input on HTML forms.

Use the following partial to add the hidden input:

```
{% include "partials/csrf-hidden-input.html" %}
```

### Reference/Reference ID encryption
In all instances where the Reference or Reference ID is used in the URL, it will be encrypted using AES encryption via the standard Node Crypto package.

Functions for encrypting/decrypting these values have been implemented in app/services/helpers directory.


## Notes

### Localisation

As a GOV.UK service this application should support Welsh.

Localisation is provided via the [i18n node module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/i18n) which populates localisation strings for the supported locales into `app/locales`. Near the end of the Beta the localisation files will be sent for translation and populated.
